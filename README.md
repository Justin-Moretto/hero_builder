# Hero Builder Prototype

This repository contains a barebones Flutter project that uses the Flame game engine. It implements the foundations of a hero-builder roguelike auto-battler inspired by **The Bazaar**.

## Features

- Basic `FlameGame` setup with shop and combat phases
- Player inventory board and stash (10 tiles each)
- Three small damage items available for purchase
- Placeholder shop/combat logic for future expansion

To build and run this project you will need Flutter installed locally. Once Flutter is installed, you can launch the game with:

```bash
flutter run
```

This project is an MVP and many features are left as TODOs throughout the code.
